== Usage ==

To use this in your own projects, either do the standard:

python setup.py install

or copy the facebook.py file into your own source tree and
use it from there.


== Documentation ==

Have a look at the examples/ directory. Most of the
stuff should be self-explanatory. There is also an example
Django app in examples/facebook, which should have enough
to get you started.

See the developer wiki for more information.
